    <h2 id ="motivation">Motivation</h2>
    <p>Human reasoning processes comprise two types of thinking: vertical and lateral. 
        Vertical thinking, also known as linear, convergent, or logical thinking, is a sequential analytical process that is based on rationality, logic, and rules.
        Meanwhile, lateral thinking (or “thinking outside the box”) is a divergent and creative process that involves looking at a problem from a new
        perspective and defying preconceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The success of language models has inspired
        the NLP community to attend to tasks that
        require implicit and complex reasoning, relying on human-like commonsense mechanisms.
        While such vertical thinking tasks have been
        relatively popular, lateral thinking puzzles have
        received little attention. To bridge this gap,
        we devise BRAINTEASER: a multiple-choice
        Question Answering task designed to test the
        model’s ability to exhibit lateral thinking and
        defy default commonsense associations.
    </p>

    <p>BRAINTEASER QA task consists of two subtasks-<strong>Sentence Puzzle</strong> and <strong>Word Puzzle</strong> 
        that require awareness of commonsense “defaults” and overwriting them through  unconventional thinking that distinguishes these defaults from hard constraints.
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sentence Puzzle</strong>: Sentence-type brain teaser where the puzzle defying commonsense is centered on sentence snippets. </li>
        <li><strong>Word Puzzle</strong>: Word-type brain teaser where the answer violates the default 
            meaning of the word and focuses on the letter composition of the target question</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both tasks include an adversarial subset, created by manually modifying the original brain teasers without changing their latent reasoning path.</p>

    <h2 id ="task-example">Task Example</h2>
    <p>Here are two examples from each subtasks</p>
    <table align="center">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Question</th>
                <th>Choice</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>A man shaves everyday, yet keeps his beard long.</td>

                    He wants to maintain his appearance.<hr>

                    None of the above.<hr>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2"><hr></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>What part of London is in France?</td>
                <td>

                    The letter O.<hr>

            </tr>
            <!-- Include other rows here -->

    </table>

    <p>To ensure that our task evaluates reasoning ability rather than memorization, we construct adversarial versions of
        the original data in two ways: </p>
        
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Semantic Reconstruction</strong> rephrases the original question
    without changing the correct answer and the distractors.</li>
        <li> <strong>Context Reconstruction</strong> keeps the 
    original reasoning path but changes both the question and the answer to describe a new situational context. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are the example of two adversarial versions of Sentence Puzzle: </p>
    <table align="center">

    <p>Each system will be evaluated based on the following two accuracy metrics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Instance-based Accuracy</strong>: We consider each question (original/adversarial) as a separate instance. We will report accuracy for the original and its adversaries.</li>
        <li> <strong>Group-based Accuracy</strong>: Each question and its associated adversarial instances form a group, and a system will only receive a score of 1 when it correctly solves all questions in the group.</li>

    <h2 id ="Notes for Codalab"><strong>We have some important notes for our task as follows:</strong></h2>
    
    <p><br /> <span>1, We update the public dataset on both GitHub and Codalab platforms. Due to the limitation of our dataset, we replaced the previous trial dataset with a proportion of training data. We wish to save more data for testing to get more consistent, and the current phase only aims to let participants be familiar with the submission format. So, for all teams who already sent their submission file on the Codalab, you can send a new submission file for the new trial data if you want to get the latest feedback. This is not mandatory, as the new trial data has the same format as the previous one, and the previous successful submission means your submission format is correct.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>2. We also allow participants to perform the task in a zero-shot manner (without access to the training data). To make the competition more fair and convenient for later system analysis, we wish each team to add&nbsp;</span><em>ZS&nbsp;</em><span>&nbsp;in their team name to state their result is conducted in a zero-shot manner. We will assume everyone that doesn't have&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em>ZS</em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their name is fine-tuning</span><br /><span>3. Here is the detailed description of the three phases in Codalab (</span><a href="https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2024/codalab" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=zh-CN&amp;q=https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2024/codalab&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698997988120000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3sno3Yuw4NIIrzlTp6AHY5">https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2024/codalab</a><span>). Here is a brief summary:</span><br /><strong>Practice Phase:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Duration: Until approximately 10 Jan 2024 (official dates to be announced).</li>
    <li>Data:Use of the official evaluation script on trial data.</li>
    <li>High limit for submissions to allow extensive testing.</li>
    <li>Public leaderboard to enable participants to verify their format and approach.</li>
    <li>Purpose: Helps participants prepare by checking formatting and initial performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Evaluation Phase:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Duration: Approximately 10 Jan to 31 Jan 2024.</li>
    <li>Data: Employment of the official evaluation script and official test data.</li>
    <li>Restriction on submissions, with emphasis typically on the final valid submission on CodaLab.</li>
    <li>Leaderboard visibility is hidden.</li>
    <li>Purpose: Official assessment phase, focusing on competition and ranking outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Post-Evaluation Phase:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Duration: Begins around 31 Jan 2024.</li>
    <li>Data: Continues the use of the official evaluation script and test data.</li>
    <li>The submission limit is set high again (e.g., 999).</li>
    <li>The public leaderboard is public.</li>
    <li>Purpose: Enables scoring of contrastive runs for detailed analysis in system description papers. Supports future analysis and scoring for systems interested in the task beyond SemEval-2024. Encourages ongoing research and analysis post-competition.</li>
